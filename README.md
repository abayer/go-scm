## Working on the code

Clone this repository and use go test...

``` 
git clone https://github.com/jenkins-x/go-scm.git
cd go-scm
go test ./...
```

## Fake driver for testing

When testing the use of go-scm its really handy to use the [fake](https://github.com/jenkins-x/go-scm/blob/master/scm/driver/fake/fake.go) provider which lets you populate the in memory resources inside the driver or query resources after a test has run.

```go 
client, data := fake.NewDefault()
```
